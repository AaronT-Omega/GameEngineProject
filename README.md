Game Information



&nbsp;	This is a very simple game project meant to showcase very basic game features using the design patterns learned in class. The game itself is a top down shooter where the player must survive a slowly growing onslaught of enemies chasing you down.



&nbsp;	Your goal is to survive for as long as you can, killing the enemies with your gun to rack up points while trying not to lose all your health. 



&nbsp;	To play, you use the WASD or Arrow keys to move, the mouse to aim, and Left Click to shoot out bullets. The enemies themselves randomly spawn within the box, and slowly spawn faster the longer you play. Once you die, you get a game over screen where you must restart the game if you want to play again.
